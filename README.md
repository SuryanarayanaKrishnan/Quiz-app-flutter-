# flutter_complete_guide

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is my first Flutter application.Its a basic quiz app which displays a unique message based on your score. This project gave me thorough idea about dart and flutter fundamentals.

To run this on your machine:
- [Make sure you have flutter  and Android virtual machine]
- [flutter create project_name]
- [copy the dart files from lib folder into yours]
- [Make ysure in pubspec.yaml your version is same as mine to avoid null check]
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
